<b> <center> Web Development / Web Programming. </center> </b><br>
 Web programming, also known as web development is the creation of web applications.
Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like
Amazon among others. Web programming is made up of two parts the Front-end and Back- End
development involving front end engineers and Back End engineers respectively.<br>
<b> Front End Developer. </b><br>
Front end developers - builds the visible parts of websites that users see and interact within their
web browsers. The front end of a website/ web application is the part a user sees and directly
interacts with. The front end is built with languages and technologies like:<br>
 • HTML.<br>
 • CSS<br>
 • JavaScript<br>
<b> HyperText Markup Language</b> (HTML) - is the backbone of the Web. Every website you visit is
built with HTML. It takes care of all the structure and content. HTML5 is the current iteration of
HTML on the Web, although sites built with older versions still run fine in your browser.<br>

<b> Cascading style sheet</b> (CSS) is what controls the way the HTML looks on the page. CSS sets the
colors, fonts, background images, and even the way the page is laid out (you can use CSS to arrange
the HTML elements on a page however you want, even if it’s different than the order they’re
arranged in the HTML file). CSS3 is the current iteration of CSS on the Web, and it adds a ton of
features for things like basic interactivity and animations.<br>
Now, you can create a website with just HTML and CSS, but it’s <b> JavaScript</b> that’s the game changer. 
To put it simply, JavaScript lets you add in interactivity, more complex animations, and
even makes it possible to build fully-featured Web applications.<br>
Back in the day (like 2012), web browsers used to be really bad at interpreting a lot of JavaScript,
so adding complex functionality with JS wasn’t always a good idea. But browsers have gotten
much more powerful, making it possible to do with JavaScript what used to be reserved for “back
end” programming languages. And there have been advances in JavaScript itself (including the
creation of frameworks like AngularJs, jQuery, and Node.js). In short, what happened is that what
we mean by “front end” development has radically changed in just a few short years.<br>
In short, front end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code up websites. They’re the
ones who take the design and create a functioning website from it. Some sites are only built with
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other sites, however, have more code hidden away in the back end of
the site, to augment or enhance the front end of the site.<br> 
<b> What is a Back End Developer?</b><br>
Back end developers build the “under the hood” parts of websites that users don’t interact with
directly.
So what does this mean for front end vs back end? While the front end is everything the user
interacts with directly, the back end is much more behind-the-scenes and can have some advantages
over front end technologies for specific projects. Back end programming languages include:<br>
 • PHP.<br>
 • Ruby.<br>
 • Python.<br>
 • Java.<br>
<br>
One thing to note: You’re probably not going to see many job listings that say a company is
looking for a “back end developer.” Instead, you’ll find listings looking for Ruby developers or PHP
developers, etc., because the actual programming language a developer knows is key to being the
right fit for a particular job. As far as what you can do with a back end language that you can’t do
with JavaScript, the list is much more limited today than it used to be. One key difference: Most
content management systems are built on a back end programming language, as are many large,
complex web applications. JavaScript can suffer from performance issues (i.e., it gets slow or even
buggy) in some cases, so while it’s now possible to use JS to build just about anything you can
think of, sometimes there are still better solutions out there. Learning to code will teach you to find
the best solution for your specific problem, and sometimes that means using a back end language.
Back end developers generally work with a front end developer to
make their code work within the site or app’s design (or to tweak
that design when necessary) and front end. Which finally brings us
to the topic of full stack.
<br> <b> What is a Full Stack Developer? </b> <br>
A full stack developer is a web developer or engineer who works with
both the front and back ends of a website or application—meaning
they can tackle projects that involve databases, building userfacing websites, or even work with clients during the planning
phase of projects.
<br><b>Full stack web developers:</b><br>
•Are familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more back end languages.<br>
•Most full stack developers specialize in a particular back end programming language, like Ruby or
PHP or Python, although some, especially if they’ve been working as a developer for a while, work
with more than one. In job listings, you’ll generally see openings for“full stack Ruby developer” or
the like.<br>
•Some full stack developers especially in 2019 also learn either project management, visual design,
web design, or user experience skills—to complete their “stack” if you will As the line between
what can be done on the front end versus back end increasingly blurs, more developers are
becoming what we call “full stack.” A lot of employers (especially agencies who work on
different kinds of sites) are looking for developers who know how to work on all the parts of a site,
so they can use the best tools for the job regardless of whether it’s technically “front end” or “back
end.” Hence the rise in companies listing full stack development on job requirements. Now,
contrary to what a lot of people think, “full stack” doesn’t necessarily mean a developer is writing
all of a site’s code themselves. Many full stack web developers spend the majority of their time in
either the front or back end code of a site. But the point is that they know enough about the code
across the entire stack that they can dive in anywhere if needed. And some full stack developers do
code entire websites, including both the front and back ends, but usually only if they are working
freelance or are the only developer working on a project.
<br> <b> WHAT IS FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT? </b><br>
Full stack development gets even more confusing because of the way it shows up in job listings.
Sometimes, you’ll see positions calling for full stack developers, sometimes full stack web
developers (BTW, if you see “full stack web developer” in a job listing, it’s same-same.), and
sometimes full stack engineers. In a second, we’ll explain the difference between full stack
developers and engineers, but first, let’s go ahead and define full stack development as well. Full
stack development includes pretty much any project where you’re working on (or building) both the
front and back end of a site or app at the same time. Essentially, it’s any web development project
that would normally require both a front end developer and back end developer—but instead, a full
stack developer fills the role of both.<br>
<b>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FULL STACK DEVELOPER AND 
FULL STACK ENGINEER.</b><br>
A full stack engineer is a senior level role for someone with the skills of a full stack developer (as
described above), but with project management experience in things like systems administration
(configuring, managing, and maintaining computer networks and systems).<br>
<b> WHAT SKILLS DO I NEED TO BECOME A FULL STACK
DEVELOPER?</b><br>
You’ll typically see a mix of front and back end skills listed on full
stack web developer job listings, including:<br>
•HTML, CSS, JavaScript.<br>
•Ideally, one or more third-party library like ReactJS or Angular.<br>
•Programming languages and libraries like Ruby, PHP, Python.<br>
•Experience with databases relation and NoSql databases.<br>
•Version control.<br>
•Knowledge of security concerns and best practices•Ideally, some knowledge of web or visual
design, plus user experience best practices.<br>
